# Box.com to HiperGator Data Transfer (Automation)

# Description

- This project automates transfer of files from box.com to HiPerGator. It has 1 Node.js file  "App.js" which when executed transfers all the content from the specified box folder to HiPerGator. This Node.js script utilizes the Box Node SDK to recursively download files and folders from specified Box folders. The script is designed to handle API rate limits gracefully by implementing a retry mechanism. It reads configuration from a JSON file and accepts folder IDs as command line arguments.

# Features
__Dynamic Configuration:__ The script reads and parses configuration from a specified JSON file, ensuring flexibility and easy maintenance.

__API Rate Limit Handling:__ In the event of API rate limit exceedance, the script intelligently retries the download after the specified waiting period, ensuring robust and reliable execution.

__Command Line Interface:__ Users can input folder IDs as command line arguments, allowing for seamless integration and customization.

__Recursive Download:__ It recursively downloads files and subfolders, maintaining the folder structure locally.

# Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure you have the following:
- __Node.js:__ Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your machine.
- __Box Developer Account:__ You need a Box developer account with 2 Factor Authentication enabled and an application configured to use the Box API.
- __Configuration File:__ This is provided in the repository, alternatively it can be downloaded when creating a new application.

#  (Optional) To create an application in box.com use the following steps:
__NOTE:__ I have already created an application with the below settings which is configured to use the Box APIs.
- If you want to create a new application, follow the below steps. If not, directly proceed to __Setup__ section at the end of the file.

#### Public and Private key pair
- Once a Custom App is created using Server Authentication with JWT, a key pair can be generated via the configuration tab within the [Developer Console](https://trailblazer.app.box.com/developers/console).
- Navigate to the Developer Console where you can generate a configuration file. This file includes a public/private keypair and a number of other application details that are necessary for authentication.
- To generate this file, navigate to the Configuration tab of the Developer Console and scroll down to the __Add and Manage Public Keys__ section.

- Click the __Generate a Public/Private Keypair__ button to have Box generate a keypair you. This will trigger the download of a JSON configuration file that you can move to your application code.


### App Authorization
